Complete course on the new version of React router = **version 7**  

**date**: December 2024
**teacher**: PedroTech
**react-router version**: 7.8.2

# Intro

React router is now being used as a **framework** instead of a **library**.  

## What does that mean?

**Originally**, React Router was primarily considered a **library** focused on routing, helping developers 
manage **navigation** and **URLs** in React apps without offering much beyond that specific function.  

**Now**, React Router is viewed more like a **framework** because:
- It offers an integrated approach to handling `routing`, `rendering`, and `data fetching`.
- It enforces **conventions** and **patterns** for how `routes`, `components`, and `data loaders` work together.

The version 7 of React router manages more of the application lifecycle and logic holistically, becoming 
**A CENTRAL STRUCTURE AROUND WHICH THE APP IS BUILT**.  

In essence, React Router moves from being a "tool you use alongside others" (library) to a "core structure you 
build your app within" (framework).

# Setting up a new application using the new React Router framework?

- run `npx create-react-router@latest .` (the `.` is to create the project in the current directory)
- once the project has been created, run `npm run dev` to start the development server
